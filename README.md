In this repo, all about Machine Learning and I covered both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Techniques with Practical Implementation. Everything from scratch and I solved a lot of different problems with different Machine Learning techniques either related to Healthcare, E-commerce, Sports, or Daily Business Issues.
